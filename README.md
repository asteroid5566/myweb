Hello, I am a college student who love coding.

This is my first website, it is made by simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I put some tutorial link about computer science on the main page. 

Also this web is a place where I try new functions and toys about web development. 

To watch the full website please visit https://asteroid5566.github.io/myweb/

Happy coding !
